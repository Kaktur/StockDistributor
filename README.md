# Disclaimer
Read the code at your own risk!

This is the first code I have ever written, so it is horrendous, but hey it does the job.

If you can bare it, feel free to contribute!

# Credits
Big thanks to Saitama298 on GitHub for making the API.py part of this app, I would not be able to do this without it,

but you still heave to use the version from this repository because I modified the original code.
